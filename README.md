# Master-Thesis

## Name: Dragon fruit yield estimation system using UAV

## Motivation: Building a camera module mounted on a UAV that collects data on images of dragon fruit and gives an estimate of dragon fruit production

## Hardware

- [x] Jetson AGX Xavier (32GB)
- [x] ZED 2 camera
- [x] Drone  

## Software

- [x] Jetpack 4.6 (rev.3)
- [x] ZED SDK

## Tasks

- [x] Model dragon fruit detection
- [ ] Record data 
- [ ] Implement model in Jetson AGX and ZED 2
- [ ] Counting Fruit (trying bounding box optical flow and SfM)
- [ ] 3D Reconstruction
